Execute an implementation plan using the executing-plans skill.

Load the skill first: `Skill(ce:executing-plans)`

## Workflow

### If no arguments provided (`$ARGUMENTS` is empty):

1. **Find available plans:**
   Search recursively for plan files regardless of folder structure:
   ```bash
   glob ./**/plans/**/*.md
   glob ./**/plans/**/README.md
   glob ./plans/**/*.md
   glob ./plans/**/README.md
   ```

   Also check common alternative locations:
   ```bash
   glob ./**/*-PLAN.md
   glob ./**/*-plan.md
   ```

   **Identify plan files by:**
   - Files in any `plans/` directory at any depth
   - Files with `-PLAN.md` or `-plan.md` suffix
   - Files containing `> **Status:**` header pattern
   - For multi-file plans: `README.md` files that contain a phase table

2. **Filter to incomplete plans:**
   - Read each plan file
   - Check the `> **Status:**` header
   - Only show plans with status `DRAFT`, `APPROVED`, or `IN_PROGRESS`
   - Skip plans marked `COMPLETED`

3. **Present options:**
   List incomplete plans with their status and a brief description (from the User Story or first line of spec).

   Use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user select which plan to execute:
   ```
   Which plan would you like to execute?
   - [plan-1-name] (APPROVED) - Brief description
   - [plan-2-name] (IN_PROGRESS) - Brief description
   ```

4. **Load the selected plan** and proceed to execution prep below.

### If plan path provided (`$ARGUMENTS` has a value):

1. **Read the plan:**
   - If path ends in `.md`: single-file plan
   - If path is a directory or ends in `/`: multi-file plan, read `README.md`

2. **Verify plan exists and is executable:**
   - Check status is not `COMPLETED`
   - If `COMPLETED`, ask if user wants to re-execute

### Execution Prep (both paths):

1. **Review the plan:**
   - Display the specification and success criteria
   - Show the high-level task/phase breakdown
   - For multi-file plans, show the phase table with current progress

2. **Assess plan size and decide on worktree:**

   **Large tasks (use worktree):**
   - Multiple phases or task groups
   - 5+ individual tasks
   - Touches 3+ subsystems/directories
   - Estimated significant refactoring or new features

   **Small tasks (no worktree needed):**
   - Single phase with few tasks
   - Fewer than 5 tasks total
   - Localized changes to 1-2 areas
   - Bug fixes or minor enhancements

   If unsure, default to using a worktree for safety.

3. **Ask clarifying questions if needed:**
   - Ambiguous requirements
   - Missing context that can't be inferred
   - Unclear dependencies or ordering

4. **Confirm execution:**
   - For small tasks: "Ready to execute this plan? This will run tasks autonomously and commit changes as each task completes."
   - For large tasks: "This is a larger task. I'll create a git worktree on a feature branch, execute there, then merge back to main when complete. Ready to proceed?"

5. **Set up worktree (if needed):**
   ```bash
   # Derive branch name from plan name (kebab-case)
   git worktree add ../worktree-<plan-name> -b feature/<plan-name>
   cd ../worktree-<plan-name>
   ```

6. **Execute:**
   Follow the `Skill(ce:executing-plans)` workflow - it handles:
   - Dependency analysis and wave computation
   - Parallel task execution
   - Auto-recovery from errors
   - Progress tracking and status updates
   - Final verification and code review
   - Archiving completed plan to `done/` folder
   - Completion summary

### Post-Execution (worktree only):

If a worktree was created:

1. **Merge back to main:**
   ```bash
   cd <original-repo>
   git merge feature/<plan-name> --no-ff -m "Merge feature/<plan-name>: <plan-summary>"
   ```

2. **Clean up worktree:**
   ```bash
   git worktree remove ../worktree-<plan-name>
   git branch -d feature/<plan-name>
   ```

3. **Notify user:** "Plan complete. Changes merged to main and worktree cleaned up."
